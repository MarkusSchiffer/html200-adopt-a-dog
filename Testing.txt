Welcome to Markus Schiffer's Adopt-a-Dog Website.
This is a site that runs using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
This site serves a business that sells puppies. It's purpose is to make its users feel comfortable
buying a dog online. Since dogs are owned by all kinds of people, the site must work well for people of
all age groups and backgrounds. These people will use all sorts of browsers and devices, and it is important that
the site is appealing to use for all of these.

Top features:
* Works well on multiple screen sizes and devices.
* Makes use of the popular and supported [jquery library](https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.4.1.min.js).
* Easy to navigate.
* Keeps track of users' carts and prevents purchasing mistakes.
* Smooth checkout process.
* Visually appealing. 


These are three user personas for people on the site: a young person looking to get a dog after settling in to a life after
college, a middle aged person looking for a dog for his kid, and an elderly person in need of a fluffy companion:

Payton Sanders:
Payton is a 26 year old woman who works for a software startup in downtown Seattle. Payton wants to get a dog so that she will
be more motivated to exercise even with her busy schedule. Payton as a dedicated Apple user. When she visits the site,
She will be using either Safari for MacOS or Safari for iOS. Being fresh out of college, Payton does not have a lot of money
to spend, and will be more than happy to adopt her dog from anyone who presents themselves as a reasonable business. However,
Payton is very choosy about which kind of dog she wants, and is willing to investigate multiple sites to find them.
Having grown up in a family with dogs, she knows a thing or two about exactly which dog breeds she wants for her situation.
In order for her to buy a dog from the Adopt-a-Dog website, she would need great pictures of the dogs and specific information
about them to make a very informed decision.

Alistair Montgomery:
Alistair is a 46 year old man who is the head of a very wealthy family. His ten year old daughter has been bugging him
relentlessly to get a dog, and Alistair simply cannot take it anymore. Alistair is looking for a way to obtain the dog
quickly and without much hassle so that he can finally get his daughter off of his back. While money is not an issue
and Alistair is not to choosy, he expects a site that runs cleanly and offers the appearance of selling with no strings
attached. Having made some of his fortune investing in Microsoft stock, Alistair runs a powerful Windows machine and uses
either Edge or Chrome. He will likely try to knock out the whole dog situation over the course of one weekend at home, and
Will not be looking from a smartphone or tablet. 

Beatrice Wainwright
Beatrice is the wife of a deceased WWII veteran. She herself is 92 years old, and is fairly active for her age. Beatrice is
not however, technically savvy in any way. She uses very old Windows7 computer and its default browser, Internet Explorer,
in the rare occasions when she needs to go online. The most important part of the website for her is ensuring that she has
a very easy time viewing all of the dogs on her own and can make a decision about which one to buy. Most likely, to make
the actual purchase, Beatrice will get some help from someone who is more tech savvy than her anyways.
